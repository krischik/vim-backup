Holds numered backups inside a seperate directory.

Automaticly purges old backups. Standart is to hold the last 10 versions.

Tested with Linux, MS-Windows and OpenVMS.

IMORTANT: Creating this plugin was only possible because vim 7 offers new file management functions - namely :mkdir, finddir() delete() and the new List datatype. This plugin won'g work with vim 6.x.
